            <p>Danny Kellyâ€™s martial arts background started when he was only five years old. His first martial arts training was in Shotokan Karate throughout his school years. Since high school he has studied Muay Thai, Boxing and what is now called MMA. Danny spent time in Thailand where Muay Thai originated. Danny has competed in Karate, Muay Thai, and Boxing. He's held five different titles in two weight classes including United States ISKA Light Heavy Weight Champion and two time golden gloves finalist. Teaching and training is what he loves most and that is why he has spent the last 20 plus years doing just that. Believing that proper body mechanics and being a good athlete are all essential to becoming a good fighter. With that said anyone can still learn to be very efficient at the skills of MMA for self-defense or just getting a great workout. Teaching has always come natural to Danny and his love of people and sport has made MSK what it is today.</p>
