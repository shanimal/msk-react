  // <p>Another important reason to exercise is the release of endorphins. Endorphins are responsible for an overall feeling of well being. This naturally occurring chemical interacts with receptors in your brain that reduce your perception of pain, create a natural euphoria that fights depression and replaces it with a positive and energizing outlook that lasts long after the workout is finished.</p>\
  // <p>So much of today's injuries are from the lack or strength and balance in the core. When we are overweight and weak, the stomach puts strain on the lower back, causing injury that could otherwise be prevented. As the human body gets older, the muscles that keep the body in the upright position are weaker causing us to have poor posture. Simple core exercises help in posture and bone density, so we largely focus on core to restore vitality and balance.</p>\
  // <p>You may be getting older, but age is only a number. So many health problems that eventually lead to a diminished quality of life can be solved with exercise, the one thing you absolutely have control over. These factors plus the chance to meet people, get and stay in shape, and feel your best are all great reasons to join our other Super Seniors at Main Street Kickboxing’s Super Seniors class.
  // <p>Your fitness level will be challenged through different exercises like walking at a fast pace, to jogging, and even running in short spurts. We will use all the muscle groups in the body through cardio and strength exercises. Through that and only that will you be able to achieve maximum fitness in the shortest time.</p>\
